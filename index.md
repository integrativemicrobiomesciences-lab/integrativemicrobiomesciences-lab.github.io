# Integrative Microbiome Sciences Laboratory 

Our lab engineers and modulates the microbiome to control host health outcomes. <br/>
We develop molecular microbiology, bioinformatics, and multi-omic approaches to define causal mechanisms in microbial communities, and then to rationally reprogram those communities toward desired host health phenotypes. <br/>
Our lab is particularly focused on infectious disease biology and antimicrobial resistance, where the ability to map, measure,and perturb microbial function in situ has immediate translational implications.

We’re building and training a team of interdisciplinary scientists, including, for example, microbiologists, bioinformaticians, ecologists, and clinicians who are interested in tackling global problems at the interface of infectious diseases, antibiotic resistance, and phage biology, from the vantage point of integrative microbiome sciences.
