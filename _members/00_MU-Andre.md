Andre Mu is a Senior Lecturer and Laboratory Head with the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Monash University, and is affiliated with the Biomedicine Discovery Institute’s *Infection*, and *Metabolism, diabetes & obesity* Programs. 

Andre has over 14 years of training across five world-leading institutions spanning three continents, each position supported by prestigious individual research fellowships, totalling >$411,000, including:
- Endeavour Research Fellowship: [*Doherty Institute*](https://www.doherty.edu.au) & [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu) (Australia & USA)<br/>
- EMBL-EBI & Sanger Research Fellowship: [*Wellcome Sanger Institute*](https://www.sanger.ac.uk) & [*EMBL-EBI*](https://www.ebi.ac.uk) (UK)<br/>
- NOMIS Foundation Research Fellowship: [*Salk Institute for Biological Studies*](https://www.salk.edu) (USA)<br/><br/><br/><br/>


Andre has trained with world-leaders in microbiology, microbiome sciences, and host-pathogen interactions, including:<br/>
- [Prof. Janelle S. Ayres](https://www.salk.edu/scientist/janelle-ayres/) (Host metabolism and pathogen interactions; Salk),<br/>
- [Prof. Rob Knight](https://knightlab.ucsd.edu/wordpress/?page_id=47) (Integrative microbiome sciences; UCSD),<br/>
- [Dr. Trevor D. Lawley](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/lawley-trevor/) (Bacteriophage genomics in early life microbiome sciences; Sanger),<br/>
- [Prof. Timothy P. Stinear](https://www.doherty.edu.au/people/tim-stinear) (Pathogen genomics; UniMelb), and<br/>
- [Prof. Richard A. Strugnell](https://www.doherty.edu.au/people/professor-richard-dick-strugnell) (Molecular microbiology; UniMelb).<br/>

His graduate research at the University of Melbourne with [Assoc. Prof., John Moreau](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/ges/staff/johnmoreau/) (UGlasgow) was in environmental sciences (microbial ecology and bioinformatics) elucidating the interactions of a 1.5-km deep subsurface microbial community using high-throughput sequencing technologies. During this time, Andre was awarded a competitive fellowship through the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada to train in anaerobic microbiology with [Prof., Gerrit Voourdouw](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/gerrit-voordouw) at the University of Calgary. 

Andre has authored 31 publications to date in journals such as *Nature Communications*, *Nature Reviews Microbiology*, and *Microbiome* – all with the common themes of microbiome sciences at the leading-edge of integrating techniques from different disciplines and omic platforms, defining future directions of research. 

Andre's hobbies include photography, live music/concerts, cycling, and football/futsal
