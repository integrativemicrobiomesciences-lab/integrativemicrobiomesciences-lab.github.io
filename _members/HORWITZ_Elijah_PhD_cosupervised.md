Eli Horwitz is joining Monash University as a PhD student with a background in bacteria-bacteriophage interactions. 
During his PhD, he’ll explore the impact of temperate bacteriophages on their host, phage genomics, and community wide phage dynamics.

Eli completed his undergraduate and master’s work at UC San Diego, including research in Justin Meyer’s lab studying the coevolution of lambda phage and its *E. coli* host. 
Before starting his PhD, he worked as the Director of Phage Innovation at Phi Therapeutics (Phyla), leading efforts to develop phage-based treatments for acne and atopic dermatitis. 
He’s broadly interested in microbial evolution, microbiome engineering, and translating microbiology learnings into real-world applications.
