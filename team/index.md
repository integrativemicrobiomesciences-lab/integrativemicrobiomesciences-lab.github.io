# {% include icon.html icon="fa-solid fa-users" %}Team

Weâ€™re building and training a team of interdisciplinary scientists, including, for example, microbiologists, bioinformaticians, ecologists, and clinicians who are interested in tackling global problems at the interface of infectious diseases, antibiotic resistance, and phage biology, from the vantage point of integrative microbiome sciences.


If you are interested in joining our team, [please get in touch](https://integrativemicrobiomesciences-lab.github.io/contact/) with a CV and cover letter explaining your interests in our research so as to initiate a conversation regarding potential opportunities.
